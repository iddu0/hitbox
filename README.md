#   Hitbox - Picklebox Continuation/Fork   #

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview:**<br>
The previous owner couldn't complete **Picklebox**, so I've made a fork to add more features and to fix some bugs Picklebox had.<br> 
It may not be as good, but it will have the same functions (maybe some more!) and everything.

## Using Hitbox
There are 3 diffrent ways to use Hitbox. One is adding a button to inject Hitbox to all websites automatically (Reccomended, can be added to any website), using the Hitbox Client in a seperate tab, and making a Bookmarklet to load Hitbox.

### Using the Hitbox Bookmarklet:

Follow these instructions to get the Hitbox Bookmarklet:<br>
1. Bookmark <b>this</b> page
2. Right-Click the Bookmark you just created - Click <b>Edit</b>
3. Replace the <b>name</b> with something like "Hitbox Bookmarklet"
4. Replace the URL with the code below:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src='https://teamhitbox.github.io/hitbox/client/book.js';s.type='text/javascript';document.head.appendChild(s);})();
```
5. Click Save, and click the Bookmark(let). The Hitbox UI should appear on your screen!

### Using the Hitbox Client:
To use the Hitbox client, Simply click [this link](https://teamhitbox.github.io/hitbox/client/)<br>
Hitbox will open in a new tab, and you can use Hitbox as usual.

### Using the "Auto add a button that Injects Hitbox" Method:

Follow these instructions to automaticlly add the Hitbox Injector button to any website:<br>
