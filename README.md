#   Hitbox - Picklebox Continuation/Fork   #

ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview:**<br>
The previous owner couldn't complete **Picklebox**, so I've made a fork to add more features and to fix some bugs Picklebox had.<br> 
It may not be as good, but it will have the same functions (maybe some more!) and everything.
